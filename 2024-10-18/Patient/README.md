# Patient

"What's wrong, Little Crocodile?"
"I want the airplane, Daddy!"
"Your sister isn't done with it yet. Wait your turn, okay? You can play with your stuffed toy while you wait."
Little Crocodile dresses up his stuffed toy. And when his sister is done, it's his turn to play with the airplane!

"Why are you so fussy, sweetie?"
"It's taking too long to get home!"
"I know. You want to be there already. Why don't you do some coloring while you wait?"
"Good job! You've been very patient." says Mommy.
Little Kangaroo feels very proud of herself.

"what's wrong, Little Monkey?"
"I want to see my daddy!"
"First we'll have a snack and play with the modeling clay. Your daddy will be here soon to pick you up."
Oh, daddy's here! But now Little Monkey wants to keep playing!

"What's going on, honey?"
"I'm hungry, Mommy."
"Dinner is almost ready. But to make things go faster, you can help me set the table."
Little Bear gets his favorite cup and spoon. Now they can eat!

"what is it, my dear?"
"I want to play with you, Daddy!"
"I'm busy right now. But when the clock's big hand is on the apple, we can play."
Hooray, Daddy is all done! Now Little Cat can play with her favorite game with him.

"Great job today, kinds! You have all been very patient."
"Give me a big hug, Daddy!"
